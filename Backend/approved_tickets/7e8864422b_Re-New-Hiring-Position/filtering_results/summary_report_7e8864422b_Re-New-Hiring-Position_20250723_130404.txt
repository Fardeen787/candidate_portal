QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW:
======================================================================
**Verification Report**

Based on the provided information, here's a review of the filtering process:

1. **Skill Requirements Evaluation**: The report does not provide specific details on how the skill requirements were evaluated. It is assumed that the top candidates selected possess the required skills (Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Django), but there is no explicit confirmation. To improve, it's recommended to include a skills assessment matrix or a summary of how each candidate's skills align with the requirements.

2. **Experience Range**: The report does not provide information on the experience range of the selected candidates. It is unclear whether the chosen candidates fall within the required 5-7 years of experience. To verify, it's essential to review the resumes or profiles of the final candidates to ensure they meet the experience requirement.

3. **Concerns about the Process**: The primary concern is the lack of transparency in the evaluation process. The report does not provide sufficient details on how the candidates were assessed, making it challenging to verify whether the requirements were properly evaluated. Additionally, the salary range of $30,000 - $40,000 seems relatively low for a full-stack engineer with 5-7 years of experience, which may indicate a potential issue with the compensation package.

4. **Recommendations for Improvement**:
	* Include a detailed skills assessment matrix to evaluate candidates' technical skills.
	* Provide explicit confirmation that the selected candidates meet the experience range requirement.
	* Consider reviewing the compensation package to ensure it's competitive and aligned with industry standards.
	* Increase transparency in the evaluation process by providing a clear summary of the assessment criteria and candidate evaluations.
	* Review the location requirement (Texas, United States) to ensure it was properly considered during the candidate selection process.
