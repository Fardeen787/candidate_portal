They have 4 years of experience but lack all the required skills, including firewalls, threat detection systems, analytical abilities, communication skills, and technical knowledge of security tools. Additionally, they do not have a continuous learning mindset and their location does not match.\n\nBoth candidates are not suitable for the cybersecurity engineer position based on the missing skills and experience requirements.",
